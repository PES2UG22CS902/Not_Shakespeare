# Not_Shakespeare
A multi modal story teller AI agent that produces stories and relevant images for it, packing it all in a neat markdown file.

A few dependencies you will need to install:
* crewai
* crewai.tools
* diffusers (you can use OpenAI if you prefer and go for DALL-E. Just make sure to change the code accordingly.)
* transformers
* torch
* ollama (Should you decide to run a local LLM or again OpenAI)

pip is your best friend for installing these.
